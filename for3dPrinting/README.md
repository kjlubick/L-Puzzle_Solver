# 3d Printing a L-puzzle solving box.

I enjoy solving these with my hands instead of just on paper.
I designed a box that has a slide out lid and can support 6x8 and 8x8 puzzles.

See the STL files for printing.
A typical print will involve:

- 1 x [L-puzzle_board.stl](https://tinkercad.com/things/2YUs7paEJ9M)
- 1 x [L_puzzle_box.stl](https://tinkercad.com/things/ds5OYtiiW2R)
- 3 x [L_pieces.stl](https://tinkercad.com/things/gOuzUWkGG5E)
- 16 x [Extra_pin.stl](https://tinkercad.com/things/aTZkPdDw5kh) (I usually print a spare)

This printed fine on an Ultimaker 2 at high settings (.6mm layer height, .25mm nozzle).
Be sure to use glue for better adhesion on the box and board, if applicable.

I've linked the above models to tinkercad for more fine-grain editing.
